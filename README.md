# Human-Activity-Recognition-HAR
A project on Human Activity Recognition using mobile sensor data and machine learning models like SVM, KNN, CNN, and LSTM.

# Human Activity Recognition (HAR)

This project demonstrates Human Activity Recognition using mobile sensor data, including accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer inputs.

## Structure
- `data/`: Sample datasets
